When to Use the Two-Pointer Approach
Consider using this technique when the problem involves: 

    A linear data structure (array, string, linked list).
    A sorted input array (or one that can be sorted).
    Finding pairs, triplets, or subarrays that satisfy a certain condition.
    Problems that ask for in-place modifications (e.g., reversing an array, moving zeros).
    Optimizing an O(n²) brute-force solution to an O(n) solution.
