1. What is Inheritance?
Inheritance is an OOP principle where one class (child) inherits features (variables + methods) of another class (parent).
👉 In simple words:
A child class reuses the code of a parent class.

2. Why is it useful?
Reduces code duplication
                                          class Vehicle:                           //Common code stays in the parent class. Subclasses only implement unique behavior.
                                              def start(self):                     //Here start() is written once, reused by Car and Bike → no repetition.
                                                  print("Engine started")
                                          
                                          class Car(Vehicle):
                                              pass
                                          
                                          class Bike(Vehicle):
                                              pass
                                          
                                          car = Car()
                                          car.start()                                        
Improves maintainability         ----------------------------------------->  //  Update Vehicle.start() → all subclasses get the fix instantly. This makes debugging and updating much easier.

Supports code organization
                                           Animal                               //Classes are arranged in a hierarchical structure, making code easier to understand.

Enables Polymorphism
                                            class Animal:                        //Polymorphism allows different subclasses to behave differently while sharing the same method name.
                                                def sound(self):                 // Different outputs, same method → polymorphism through inheritance.
                                                    pass
                                            
                                            class Dog(Animal):
                                                def sound(self):
                                                    print("Bark")
                                            
                                            class Cat(Animal):
                                                def sound(self):
                                                    print("Meow")
                                            
                                            def animal_sound(a):
                                                a.sound()
                                            
                                            animal_sound(Dog())   # Bark
                                            animal_sound(Cat())   # Meow

4. Types of Inheritance
1️⃣ Single Inheritance
One child inherits from one parent.
                                          class Animal:
                                              def eat(self):
                                                  print("Animal eats")
                                          
                                          class Dog(Animal):   # Dog inherits Animal
                                              def bark(self):
                                                  print("Dog barks")

                                          d = Dog()
                                          d.eat()   # parent method
                                          d.bark()  # child method
2️⃣ Multilevel Inheritance
A inherits B, B inherits C.
                                          class LivingBeing:
                                              def breathe(self):
                                                  print("Breathing")
                                          
                                          class Animal(LivingBeing):
                                              def move(self):
                                                  print("Animal moves")
                                          
                                          class Dog(Animal):
                                              def bark(self):
                                                  print("Dog barks")

                                          d = Dog()
                                          d.breathe()
                                          d.move()
                                          d.bark()
3️⃣ Multiple Inheritance
Child inherits from multiple parents.
                                          class Father:
                                              def skills(self):
                                                  print("Father: driving")
                                          
                                          class Mother:
                                              def skills(self):
                                                  print("Mother: cooking")
                                          
                                          class Child(Father, Mother):
                                              pass
                                          
                                          c = Child()
                                          c.skills()      # invokes Father’s skill (based on MRO)
4️⃣ Hierarchical Inheritance
Multiple children inherit the same parent.
                                         

5️⃣ Hybrid Inheritance
Combination of more than one type.

8. Method Overriding (Very Important)
Child class can override (change) parent class method.
 class Animal:
                                              def sound(self):
                                                  print("Some sound")
                                          
                                          class Dog(Animal):
                                              def sound(self):  # overriding
                                                  print("Bark")

9. super() – Calling Parent Class Methods
                                            class Animal:
                                                def sound(self):
                                                    print("Animal sound")
                                            
                                            class Dog(Animal):
                                                def sound(self):
                                                    super().sound()   # call parent method
                                                    print("Dog barks")
