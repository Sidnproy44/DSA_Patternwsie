⭐ What is a Constructor?
A constructor is a special method inside a class that is automatically called when an object is created.
It is used to:
Initialize object variables
Set default values
Allocate resources
Ensure the object starts in a valid state

⭐ Why Do We Need Constructors?
✔ Automatically run when object is created
✔ Avoids manually setting attributes every time
✔ Helps initialize data cleanly
✔ Makes code more readable and error-free

                                              class Student:
                                                  def __init__(self, name, roll):
                                                      self.name = name
                                                      self.roll = roll
                                              
                                              s = Student("John", 10)
                                              print(s.name, s.roll)

1️⃣ name and roll are just temporary variables. b They exist only inside the constructor. Once the constructor finishes, these variables disappear. So we must store them (using self.name,self.roll) inside the object. 


✅ Does a class take arguments?
p = Player(health=80, level=3)
It looks like the class Player is taking arguments……but actually:
✔️ The class itself does NOT take arguments.
✔️ The arguments are passed to the constructor method __init__() inside the class.
Python does two things:
1️⃣ Creates an empty object of class Player (behind the scenes using __new__())
2️⃣ Calls the constructor __init__(self, 80, 3) and assigns the values to the object.


What does object c contain?   c = Car("BMW", 120)
Attributes:  c.brand → "BMW"    c.speed → 120
Methods:  c.accelerate()


✅ Scope of self.name and self.roll_no
✔️ These variables belong to the object (instance) of the class.
✔️ Their scope is anywhere inside the class, in any method, as long as you access them through self.
because self refers to the current object, and the variables attached to self become object-level variables.

Accessed using:
self.variable (inside class)
object.variable (outside class)
2️⃣ Local Variables
Definition: Variables created inside a method that belong only to that method.
Where stored? --------------> Only inside the method’s temporary memory. Lifetime: Destroyed once the method finishes executing.
